---------------
OSI MODEL
---------------
-is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven layers

1.Physical Layer (Layer 1) --> Deals with the physical connection between devices e.g. cables, switches, and network interface cards (NICs)

2.Data Link Layer (Layer 2) --> Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
-Divided into two sublayers:
i. MAC (Media Access Control): Controls how devices access the medium.
ii. LLC (Logical Link Control): Manages frame synchronization and error checking.
e.g. Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), MAC addresses.
- PDU comprises:
i. Original data with TCP/UDP header
ii. Network layer header 

3.Network Layer (Layer 3) --> Manages data routing, addressing, and packet forwarding. Determines the best path for data to reach its destination
e.g. IP (Internet Protocol), routers, IPv4, IPv6.

4.Transport Layer (Layer 4) -->Ensures reliable data transfer and manages end-to-end communication. Handles error recovery, data flow control, and segmentation.
e.g. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5.Session Layer (Layer 5) --> Manages sessions between applications. Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
e.g.: Remote procedure calls (RPCs), PPTP.

6.Presentation Layer (Layer 6) -->Translates data between the application layer and the network. Handles data encryption, compression, and format conversion.
Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII, encryption standards.


7.Application Layer (Layer 7) --> Closest to the end user. Provides network services to applications (e.g., web browsers, email clients).
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, web browsers


Summary:
Layer 1 (Physical): Bits.
Layer 2 (Data Link): Frames.
Layer 3 (Network): Packets.
Layer 4 (Transport): Segments.
Layer 5 (Session): Sessions.
Layer 6 (Presentation): Data translation.
Layer 7 (Application): User interaction.

-Data at first 4 layers(l1 -> l4) are known as PDU
-last 3 (l3 -> l7) thers no encapsulation or decapsulations







- The Two Main Transport Layer Protocols:
    - In computer networks, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are the two primary transport layer protocols responsible for transmitting data over the internet. 

=============================================
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
=============================================
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data. It is widely used in applications where data integrity is critical, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.

Key Features of TCP
-------------------
1. Reliable Data Transmission
- TCP ensures data is received correctly and in order.
- Uses acknowledgment (ACK) messages to confirm receipt.
- Retransmits lost packets.

2. Connection-Oriented
- Establishes a connection before data transfer using the three-way handshake:
i. Client sends a SYN (synchronize) request to the server.
ii. Server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge).
iii. Client replies with an ACK, establishing the connection.

3. Error Detection and Correction
- Uses checksums and retransmissions to ensure data accuracy.

4. Ordered Data Transfer
- Uses sequence numbers to ensure packets arrive in the correct order.

5. Flow Control (Windowing Mechanism)
- Adjusts the transmission rate based on network congestion.

6. Congestion Control
- Uses algorithms like Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance to prevent overwhelming the network.

Use Cases of TCP
-----------------
1. Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
2. Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
3. File transfer (FTP, SFTP)
4. Remote access (SSH, Telnet)



=============================================
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
=============================================
- UDP is a connectionless, fast, and lightweight protocol that does not guarantee reliability or ordered delivery. It is used in applications where speed is more critical than accuracy.

1. Fast and Efficient
- No connection setup or acknowledgment process.
- Low overhead, making it faster than TCP.

2. Connectionless Communication
- No prior handshake; packets are sent without establishing a connection.

3. No Guaranteed Delivery
- Packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order.

4. No Error Correction
- If data is lost, UDP does not retransmit it.

5. Broadcast and Multicast Support
- Suitable for real-time applications where multiple receivers need data.


Use Cases of UDP
-----------------
1. Live video streaming (YouTube Live, Twitch)
2. Online gaming (Call of Duty, Fortnite)
3. VoIP calls (Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp Calls)
4. DNS lookups (Domain Name System)
5. IoT (Internet of Things) communications
