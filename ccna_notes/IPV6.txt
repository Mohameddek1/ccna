### ‚úÖ What is IPv6?
=============================

- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)** is the successor to IPv4, designed to solve the problem of IP address exhaustion. While IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, IPv6 uses **128-bit** addresses.
- It was developed by the **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)** and is defined in **RFC 8200**.
- IPv6 is not backward compatible with IPv4, meaning they cannot directly communicate without translation mechanisms.
- first half of the address is the **network part**, and the second half is the **host part**.
- IPv6 is designed to be more efficient and secure than IPv4, with features like **auto-configuration**, **multicast**, and **IPSec**.


--------------------------------
### üìå Key Features of IPv6
--------------------------------

| Feature               | IPv4                     | IPv6                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Address length        | 32-bit                   | 128-bit                            |
| Address format        | Decimal (e.g., 192.0.2.1)| Hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:db8::1)    |
| Address space         | ~4.3 billion             | ~340 undecillion (3.4√ó10¬≥‚Å∏)        |
| Header complexity     | Complex, varied          | Simplified, fixed-length headers   |
| NAT (Network Address Translation) | Common     | Not needed (due to enough addresses)|
| Auto-configuration    | Limited (DHCP)           | Built-in (SLAAC or DHCPv6)         |
| Security              | Optional (IPSec)         | Built-in IPSec support             |
| Broadcast             | Yes                      | No (uses multicast instead)        |

### üß± IPv6 Address Structure

IPv6 addresses are written in eight **16-bit hexadecimal blocks**, separated by colons:

```
2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

**Shortened format (rules):**
- Leading zeros in each block can be dropped.
- Consecutive all-zero blocks can be compressed using `::` once per address.

Example:  
`2001:db8:0:42:0:8a2e:370:7334` ‚Üí `2001:db8:0:42::8a2e:370:7334`

---

### üéØ Types of IPv6 Addresses

| Type              | Purpose                                | Prefix           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Unicast**        | One-to-one communication               | `2000::/3` (global) |
| **Multicast**      | One-to-many (like sending to a group) | `FF00::/8`       |
| **Anycast**        | One-to-nearest (in a group)           | Uses unicast prefix |
| **Link-local**     | Local network communication only       | `FE80::/10`      |
| **Loopback**       | Device self-test                       | `::1`            |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è IPv6 Address Configuration

1. **Manual (Static)**  
2. **SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration)**  
   - Uses Router Advertisements to auto-configure.  
3. **DHCPv6 (Stateful)**  
   - Like DHCP for IPv4 but for IPv6.

---

### üö´ No More NAT?

Yes. With so many addresses available, every device can have a **globally unique address**, eliminating the need for NAT (though it's still used in some scenarios).

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Security

IPv6 was designed with **IPSec** in mind ‚Äî for **authentication, integrity, and encryption** of IP packets.

### üñºÔ∏è **Network Topology (Simple Diagram)**

```
             [ ISP ]
               |
           [ Router ] <----- Provides IPv6 addressing
               |
          [ Switch ]
           /       \
   [ Laptop A ]   [ Laptop B ]
```

To set up **IPv6 on a router** for a LAN with a switch and 2 laptops, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide. I‚Äôll show you a generic setup first (conceptually), then I‚Äôll show you how to configure it using **Cisco IOS**, since that‚Äôs common in labs and learning environments.

---

## ‚úÖ **What You Need**

- A router with IPv6 support (e.g., Cisco)
- A switch (Layer 2, no config needed)
- Two laptops connected to the switch
- A delegated IPv6 prefix (or use Unique Local Address `fd00::/8` if no ISP)

---

## üåê **Step-by-Step Setup (Cisco Style)**

`### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Enable IPv6 Routing`
``Router(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
``

---

`### üì∂ 2. Configure the Router‚Äôs LAN Interface`
Let‚Äôs say you're using interface **GigabitEthernet0/0** connected to the switch.

``Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:abcd::1/64
Router(config-if)# ipv6 nd other-config-flag
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
``

> This assigns an IPv6 address and enables Neighbor Discovery (ND) with SLAAC.

---

`### üåç 3. (Optional) Configure the Router‚Äôs WAN Interface (to ISP)`
Let‚Äôs assume the router gets an IPv6 address from the ISP:

``Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address dhcp
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
``

Or use a static public IPv6 if provided:
```bash
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:1::1/64
```

---

`### üß© 4. Enable DHCPv6 (Optional but Useful)`
If you want the router to offer more config (like DNS), you can also configure **DHCPv6 server** on the router.

``Router(config)# ipv6 dhcp pool MYPOOL
Router(config-dhcpv6)# address prefix 2001:db8:abcd::/64
Router(config-dhcpv6)# dns-server 2001:4860:4860::8888
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 dhcp server MYPOOL
``

---

`## üß™ Verify Everything`

### On the router:
``show ipv6 interface brief
show ipv6 route
``

### On laptops (Linux/macOS):
``ip -6 addr
ping6 google.com
``

---

## üí° What Happens Automatically

- Router advertises the network prefix `2001:db8:abcd::/64` via SLAAC.
- Laptops auto-configure IPv6 addresses like `2001:db8:abcd::abcd`.
- Laptops route through `2001:db8:abcd::1` (the router).

---




================================
üîó Link-Local Address in IPv6
================================
- A Link-Local address is a special type of IPv6 address that is used only for communication between devices on the same local network (LAN segment) ‚Äî it cannot be routed outside that link.
- its not routable, meaning it won't be forwarded by routers to other networks.
- Link-Local addresses are automatically generated by devices when IPv6 is enabled, and they are used for various network functions, such as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and address autoconfiguration.

`üîç Purpose of Link-Local Address:`
- **Local Communication:** Used for communication between devices on the same local network segment.
- **Neighbor Discovery:** Helps devices discover each other and determine their link-layer addresses.
- **Routing Protocols:** Used by routing protocols to communicate between routers on the same link.
- **Auto-Configuration:** Devices can automatically configure their own Link-Local addresses without needing a DHCP server.

`üîë Characteristics of Link-Local Address:`
- **Prefix:** Always starts with `FE80::/10`.
- **Scope:** Limited to the local link (not routable beyond the local network).
- **Auto-Configured:** Automatically assigned to every IPv6-enabled interface when IPv6 is enabled.
- **No Manual Configuration Needed:** No need for DHCP or manual setup.
- **Unique:** Each device generates its own Link-Local address based on its MAC address (using the EUI-64 format) or randomly.
- **Not Globally Unique:** Link-Local addresses are not unique across different networks, but they are unique within the same local link.
   
`üìå Format of Link-Local Address:`
``FE80::/10
``
This means:
- All link-local addresses start with FE80, FE81, FE82, up to FEBF.
- The rest of the address is often auto-configured using the device‚Äôs MAC address.

`üîó Example of Link-Local Address:`
``fe80::1a2b:3c4d:5e6f:7g8h
``

`‚úÖ Key Points:`
- Automatically assigned to every IPv6-enabled interface.
- Used for:
+ Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
+ Routing protocols between routers
- No DHCP or manual config needed.
- Always stays local to a link (e.g., a LAN or VLAN).




=============================================
changing IPv6 link-local addresses
=============================================
- By default, **IPv6 link-local addresses** are **automatically generated** based on the device‚Äôs **MAC address**. However, you **can manually set** or change a link-local address.

---

### üíª **On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

1. **Use `ip` command:**
``sudo ip -6 addr add fe80::1234:abcd dev eth0
``

> `fe80::1234:abcd` is the new link-local address  
> `eth0` is your network interface

2. **Verify it:**
``ip -6 addr show dev eth0
``

---

### ü™ü **On Windows:**

1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**
2. Run:
``netsh interface ipv6 set address "Ethernet" fe80::1234:abcd
``

> Replace `"Ethernet"` with the actual name of your interface

---

### üõú **On Cisco Router (IOS):**

``Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# interface fastEthernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 enable
Router(config-if)# mac-address 0011.2233.4455       ! Change MAC address
Router(config-if)# no shutdown                      ! Bring interface back up
Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)# end
``
physically:
``Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address fe80::1234:abcd link-local
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
``
‚úÖ This **overrides the auto-generated link-local address**.





======================================
IPv6 Multicast Group
======================================
- IPv6 multicast groups allow a single sender to send traffic to multiple receivers without broadcasting to everyone.
- Multicast traffic is sent to an IPv6 multicast address, and hosts can join or leave these groups using MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery).
- Multicast addresses start with `FF00::/8`.
- The multicast address is followed by a **flags field** and a **scope field** to define the type of multicast and its reach.
- The **flags field** indicates whether the multicast is **permanent** or **temporary**, and the **scope field** indicates the range of the multicast (e.g., link-local, site-local, global).
- Multicast addresses are used for various applications, including streaming media, video conferencing, and routing protocols like OSPFv3 and EIGRP for IPv6.
- Multicast is more efficient than broadcast because it only sends data to interested receivers, reducing network congestion.
- IPv6 multicast is used in applications like **streaming video**, **online gaming**, and **routing protocols** (e.g., OSPFv3, EIGRP for IPv6).

**üéØ IPv6 Multicast Address Format**
- IPv6 multicast addresses start with FF, like this:
``FFXY::/16
``
Where:
- X is the scope (e.g., 1 = Interface-local, 2 = Link-local, E = Global)
- Y is the flag (usually 0)
Example multicast group: FF1E::1 (global-scope multicast)

**üß™ IPv6 Multicast Lab Setup (GNS3)**
üìç Topology
[ Sender ] ---- (R1) ---- (R2) ---- (R3) ---- [ Receiver ]

`‚úÖ Step 1: Enable IPv6 Routing and PIM on All Routers`
``R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R1(config)# ipv6 multicast-routing
R1(config)# interface g0/1
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:1::1/64
R1(config-if)# ipv6 pim sparse-mode
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# interface g0/2
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:12::1/64
R1(config-if)# ipv6 pim sparse-mode
``

`‚úÖ Step 2: Set Up Static RP (R1)`
``R1(config)# ipv6 pim rp-address 2001:1::1 ff0E::/16
``
- This means R1 is the RP for all global-scope multicast (ff0E::/16).

`‚úÖ Step 3: Enable MLD Join on Receiver Interface (R3)`
``R3(config)# interface g0/2
R3(config-if)# ipv6 mld join-group FF0E::1
``
- This tells R3 to join the multicast group FF0E::1.

`‚úÖ Step 4: Send Multicast from Host (Sender)`
``Sender# ping -6 -I eth0 FF0E::1
``
- This sends a multicast ping to the group FF0E::1.

`‚úÖ Step 5: Verification Commands`
``# Check PIM neighbors
show ipv6 pim neighbor
# Check MLD groups
show ipv6 mld groups
# Check multicast routing table
show ipv6 route | include FF

``




================================
Neighbor Discovery (ND) in IPv6
================================
- Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) in IPv6 is the replacement for **ARP, ICMP Router Discovery, and ICMP Redirects** in IPv4.

It‚Äôs used for:
- ‚úÖ **Router discovery**  
- ‚úÖ **Prefix discovery**  
- ‚úÖ **Parameter discovery**  
- ‚úÖ **Address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)**  
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)**  
- ‚úÖ **Neighbor reachability detection**  
- ‚úÖ **Redirect functionality**

---

## üí° ICMPv6 Message Types Used in NDP

| Message Type         | Description                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Router Solicitation (RS)** | Host to Router: "Any router out there?" |
| **Router Advertisement (RA)** | Router to Host: "Yes, here I am, and here‚Äôs some config!" |
| **Neighbor Solicitation (NS)** | "Who has this IPv6 address?" (like ARP request) |
| **Neighbor Advertisement (NA)** | "I have that IPv6 address!" (like ARP reply) |
| **Redirect**         | Informs a host of a better next-hop |

---

**## üß™ Simple GNS3 Lab Example**

### üìçTopology

``[PC1] --- (R1) --- [PC2]
``

---

`### ‚úÖ Step 1: Configure IPv6 on R1`
``R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R1(config)# interface g0/0
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:1::1/64
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
``

---

`### ‚úÖ Step 2: PC1 and PC2 IPv6 Configuration`
If you're simulating PCs with **Cisco routers or hosts**, do:

``PC1(config)# interface g0/0
PC1(config-if)# ipv6 address autoconfig
PC1(config-if)# ipv6 enable
``

Same for PC2. They will **learn the prefix** and **default gateway** from R1 via **Router Advertisements (RA)**.

---

`### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verification`

On PC1:
``# To view IPv6 neighbors
show ipv6 neighbors
``

On R1:
``# To see neighbor entries (ND Cache)
show ipv6 neighbors
# To see RS and RA
debug ipv6 nd
``

---

## üîÑ Neighbor Discovery Packet Flow (Like ARP for IPv6)

1. **PC1 wants to reach PC2**, but doesn‚Äôt know the MAC for PC2‚Äôs IPv6.
2. Sends **Neighbor Solicitation (NS)** for PC2‚Äôs address.
3. PC2 responds with **Neighbor Advertisement (NA)**.
4. Now PC1 can forward packets directly using the MAC address.

---



=================================================
üß† What is a Router Advertisement (RA)? in IPv6
=================================================

- A Router Advertisement is an ICMPv6 packet sent by a router to inform IPv6 hosts about:
* üì° The router‚Äôs existence (default gateway)
* üìç Network prefixes
* üß≠ Flags that tell hosts how to get an IPv6 address (SLAAC, DHCPv6, etc.)
* ‚è±Ô∏è Valid and preferred lifetimes for the prefix
* üéØ MTU for the link

`üõ†Ô∏è When is an RA Sent?`
- RA messages are sent by a router:
* ‚úÖ Periodically (by default every 200 seconds)
* ‚úÖ Immediately after receiving a Router Solicitation (RS) from a host


`üì¶ RA Packet Fields`
- Here are the main fields found inside an RA packet:
| Field               | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cur Hop Limit**   | Default hop limit for outgoing packets              |
| **M Flag**          | Managed: Use DHCPv6 for address info                |
| **O Flag**          | Other: Use DHCPv6 for additional info (e.g. DNS)    |
| **Router Lifetime** | How long this router is a default gateway           |
| **Reachable Time**  | Used for ND reachability (in ms)                    |
| **Retrans Timer**   | Used for NS retries (in ms)                         |
| **Options**         | Includes prefix info, MTU, link-layer address, etc. |


**üß™ GNS3 Lab Setup: R1 and PC**
- R1 Configuration:
``R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R1(config)# interface g0/0
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:1::1/64
R1(config-if)# ipv6 nd prefix 2001:db8:1::/64
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
``
Simulated PC Configuration:
``PC(config)# interface g0/0
PC(config-if)# ipv6 enable
PC(config-if)# ipv6 address autoconfig
``

The PC will automatically:
- Receive the RA
- Learn the prefix
- Configure its own IPv6 address (SLAAC)
- Learn the default gateway

`üîç Verifying RA`
On R1:
``R1# show ipv6 interface g0/0
R1# debug ipv6 nd
``
On PC:
``# To view default gateway learned from RA
ip -6 route show
# See auto-configured IPv6 address
ip -6 addr
``

**üìä Wireshark Snapshot (RA packet)**
- A Router Advertisement packet typically contains:
* Type: 134 (RA)
* Code: 0
* Source Address: Router‚Äôs link-local address
* Destination: ff02::1 (all-nodes multicast)

**üß† Summary**
| Purpose of RA   | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Default Gateway | Tells hosts where to send outbound traffic |
| Prefix Info     | Used for SLAAC address generation          |
| Network Params  | MTU, timers, reachable time                |
| DHCP Flags      | Controls use of DHCPv6                     |



==============================================
IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration
==============================================
1. Overview
- IPv6 address autoconfiguration allows devices to automatically generate their own IP addresses without needing manual configuration or a DHCP server. There are two main types:
* Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
* Stateful Address Autoconfiguration (DHCPv6)

2. Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
- SLAAC allows a host to configure its IPv6 address using:
* The prefix advertised by a router in Router Advertisement (RA) messages
* Its own Interface Identifier (typically derived from the MAC address or generated randomly)

Process:
i. Host sends a Router Solicitation (RS) message to request configuration info.
ii. Router replies with a Router Advertisement (RA).
iii. Host receives RA and:
* Extracts the advertised prefix
* Appends Interface ID to form a full IPv6 address
* Optionally sets default gateway and DNS based on RA flags

3. Stateful Address Autoconfiguration (DHCPv6)
- With stateful configuration, a DHCPv6 server assigns IPv6 addresses and additional configuration information (e.g., DNS).
- RA messages can still be used, but with the Managed (M) flag set to instruct hosts to use DHCPv6.

4. Configuration Example (Cisco Devices)
- Router Configuration (R1):
``R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:1::1/64
R1(config-if)# ipv6 nd prefix 2001:db8:1::/64
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
``

- Host (Simulated PC):
``interface g0/0
ipv6 enable
ipv6 address autoconfig
``

5. Verifying Autoconfiguration

- On Router:
``show ipv6 interface g0/0
debug ipv6 nd``

- On PC:
``ip -6 addr
ip -6 route show
tcpdump -i eth0 icmp6  # To see RS/RA exchanges
``

6. Key Points
* RA messages are essential for IPv6 autoconfiguration.
* SLAAC is simple and suitable for many environments.
* DHCPv6 is used when more control is needed.
* Devices use link-local addresses (fe80::/10) to communicate initially.





===================================
IPv6 Static Routing
===================================
- Static routing in IPv6 is the manual configuration of routes. You define the destination IPv6 network and the next-hop IPv6 address or exit interface. This is useful for simple or small networks where dynamic routing is not required.

`üß™ Example Topology`
[PC1]---R1---R2---R3---[PC2]

R1 <--> R2 <--> R3

IPv6 Addressing:
- PC1: 2001:DB8:1::10/64
- R1-R2 link: 2001:DB8:12::/64
- R2-R3 link: 2001:DB8:23::/64
- PC2: 2001:DB8:3::10/64


`üîß Configuration Steps`
‚úÖ R1
``interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1::1/64
 no shutdown
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:12::1/64
 no shutdown
# Static Route to reach PC2 Network via R2
ipv6 route 2001:DB8:3::/64 2001:DB8:12::2
``

‚úÖ R2
``interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:12::2/64

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:23::1/64

# Static route to PC1
ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1::/64 2001:DB8:12::1
# Static route to PC2
ipv6 route 2001:DB8:3::/64 2001:DB8:23::2
``

‚úÖ R3
``interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:23::2/64
 no shutdown
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:3::1/64
 no shutdown
# Static route to PC1
ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1::/64 2001:DB8:23::1
``

‚úÖ PC IPv6 Configuration
* PC1: ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1::10/64
* PC2: ipv6 address 2001:DB8:3::10/64
* Set default gateway to the router on each subnet.

`üîç Verification Commands`
``show ipv6 route
ping ipv6 2001:DB8:3::10  # From PC1 to PC2
traceroute ipv6 2001:DB8:3::10
``



========================================================
RIPng (RIP Next Generation)
========================================================
- RIPng is the IPv6 version of the Routing Information Protocol (RIP). It is used for routing IPv6 packets within a local area network (LAN) or a small to medium-sized network. RIPng is a distance-vector routing protocol, meaning it uses hop count as its metric for determining the best path to a destination.
- RIPng is defined in **RFC 2080** and is an extension of the original RIP protocol, which was designed for IPv4 networks. It uses the same principles as RIP but has been adapted to work with IPv6 addresses and features.
- RIPng is a simple and easy-to-configure routing protocol, making it suitable for small networks or as a backup routing protocol in larger networks. However, it has limitations in terms of scalability and convergence time compared to more advanced protocols like OSPFv3 or EIGRP for IPv6.
- It is important to note that RIPng is not suitable for large or complex networks due to its limitations in scalability and convergence time.

`üîë Key Features of RIPng`
- Uses hop count as the metric (maximum of 15 hops).
- Supports IPv6 addresses and networks.
- Uses UDP as the transport protocol (port 521).
- Supports multicast for routing updates (using FF02::9 as the multicast address).
- Simple configuration and easy to understand.
- Does not support authentication or encryption natively (though it can be used with IPsec for security).
- Uses the same basic principles as RIP for IPv4, such as periodic updates and split horizon.

`üìå Limitations of RIPng`
- Maximum hop count of 15 (16 is considered unreachable).
- Slow convergence time compared to other protocols like OSPF or EIGRP.
- Limited scalability for larger networks.
- No support for variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) or classless inter-domain routing (CIDR).
- Does not support route summarization.

- RIPng packets consist of a header and a series of route entries. The header contains information about the version, type, and length of the packet, while the route entries contain the destination prefix, prefix length, metric, and next-hop address.

`üõ†Ô∏è RIPng Configuration Steps`
- Enable IPv6 routing on the router.
- Configure the router interfaces with IPv6 addresses.
- Enable RIPng on the interfaces that will participate in RIPng routing.
- Define the RIPng routing process and specify the interfaces to be included in the RIPng routing domain.
- Optionally, configure route summarization or other advanced features if needed.

`üîç Verification Commands`
- Use the following commands to verify RIPng operation:
``show ipv6 route rip  # Check the routing table for RIPng routes
show ipv6 rip  # Display RIPng routing information
show ipv6 rip database  # Show the RIPng database
ping ipv6 <destination>  # Test connectivity to a destination
``

---

`üß† What is RIPng?`
- RIPng is a distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6.
- Uses UDP port 521.
- Hop-count based metric, max hop count = 15.
- Requires IPv6 to be enabled on the interfaces.
- Requires routing to be enabled via the ipv6 router rip <name> process.

===============================================
OSPFv3 (Open Shortest Path First for IPv6)
===============================================
- OSPFv3 is the IPv6 version of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol. It is used for routing IPv6 packets within a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). OSPFv3 is a link-state routing protocol, meaning it maintains a complete topology of the network and calculates the shortest path to each destination based on link costs.

`üîë Key Features of OSPFv3`
- Supports IPv6 addressing and networks.
- Uses link-state advertisements (LSAs) to share routing information.
- Uses the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path to each destination.
- Supports multiple areas and hierarchical routing.
- Supports authentication and encryption for secure routing updates.
- Supports route summarization and traffic engineering.
- Supports IPv6 multicast for routing updates (using FF02::5 and FF02::6 as multicast addresses).
- Supports multiple routing instances (VRFs) for better network segmentation.

`üìå Limitations of OSPFv3`
- More complex to configure compared to distance-vector protocols like RIPng.
- Higher resource requirements (CPU and memory) due to maintaining a complete topology.
- Slower convergence time compared to other protocols like EIGRP for IPv6.
- Requires more configuration and management compared to simpler protocols.
- Not suitable for very small networks where simpler protocols like RIPng or static routing would suffice.

`üîç OSPFv3 Packet Structure`
- OSPFv3 packets consist of a header and a series of link-state advertisements (LSAs). The header contains information about the version, type, and length of the packet, while the LSAs contain information about the network topology, including the router ID, link state, and cost.


`üìå What is OSPFv3?`
- A link-state routing protocol designed for IPv6.
- Uses multicast addresses FF02::5 (All OSPF Routers) and FF02::6 (All OSPF DR/BDR).
- Uses Router IDs (still in IPv4 format).
- Configured directly on interfaces (no network command like in OSPFv2).

`üß™ Example Topology`
``PC1 --- R1 --- R2 --- R3 --- PC2
IPv6 Subnets:
- PC1: 2001:DB8:1::10/64
- R1-R2: 2001:DB8:12::/64
- R2-R3: 2001:DB8:23::/64
- PC2: 2001:DB8:3::10/64
``

========================================
EIGRP for IPv6 (EIGRPv6)
========================================
- EIGRP for IPv6 (EIGRPv6) is the IPv6 version of the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). It is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses a combination of distance-vector and link-state features. EIGRPv6 is designed to work with IPv6 networks and provides efficient routing for both small and large networks.

`üîë Key Features of EIGRPv6`
- Supports IPv6 addressing and networks.
- Uses the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) for loop-free routing and fast convergence.
- Supports multiple network layer protocols (IPv4, IPv6, etc.) in a single routing domain.
- Uses multicast for routing updates (using FF02::A as the multicast address).
- Supports route summarization and traffic engineering.
- Supports authentication and encryption for secure routing updates.
- Supports unequal-cost load balancing.
- Supports IPv6 multicast for routing updates (using FF02::A as the multicast address).
- Supports multiple routing instances (VRFs) for better network segmentation.

`üìå Limitations of EIGRPv6`
- More complex to configure compared to distance-vector protocols like RIPng.
- Higher resource requirements (CPU and memory) due to maintaining a complete topology.
- Slower convergence time compared to other protocols like OSPF or EIGRP for IPv4.
- Requires more configuration and management compared to simpler protocols.
- Not suitable for very small networks where simpler protocols like RIPng or static routing would suffice.

`üîç EIGRPv6 Packet Structure`
- EIGRPv6 packets consist of a header and a series of routing information fields. The header contains information about the version, type, and length of the packet, while the routing information fields contain information about the network topology, including the router ID, link state, and cost.

`## üìò Key Concepts of EIGRPv6`
* Uses **IPv6 addresses** directly on interfaces.
* Requires **`ipv6 unicast-routing`**.
* Uses a **router ID** (still in IPv4 format).
* **Enabled per interface**, not globally with a `network` command like IPv4 EIGRP.
* Uses multicast address **FF02::A** to communicate between routers.
