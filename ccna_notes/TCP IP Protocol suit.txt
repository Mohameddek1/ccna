 TCP/IP protocol suite
------------------------

-The TCP/IP protocol suite (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of networking protocols that allows communication across interconnected networks.

----------------------------
4 Layers of the TCP/IP Model
----------------------------

1.Application Layer --> Corresponds to the OSI model's Application, Presentation, and Session layers. Provides high-level protocols for network communication. Facilitates user interaction with the network through services like web browsing, email, and file transfer.

Protocols:
HTTP/HTTPS: Web browsing.
FTP: File transfer.
SMTP: Email transmission.
DNS: Domain name resolution.
SNMP: Network management


2.Transport Layer --> Ensures reliable data transfer between devices. Manages error detection, flow control, and data segmentation.

Supports two main protocols:

Protocols:

i. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures data delivery.
ii. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Faster, connectionless protocol without guaranteed delivery, suitable for real-time applications like streaming.


3.Internet Layer --> Handles logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding across networks. Determines the best path for data delivery.

Protocols:

i. IP (Internet Protocol): Core protocol for addressing and routing packets.
IPv4: 32-bit addressing.
IPv6: 128-bit addressing.

ii. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used for error reporting and diagnostics (e.g., ping).

iii. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.

iv. RARP (Reverse ARP): Maps MAC addresses to IP addresses.

4.Network Access Layer (Link Layer) --> Handles physical hardware connections and the transmission of data frames. Interacts with the physical medium (cables, switches).

Examples:
Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).
