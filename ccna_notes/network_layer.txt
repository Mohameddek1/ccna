Network Layer
=============

The network layer is the third layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. It is responsible for the delivery of packets from the source host to the destination host across multiple networks. The primary functions of the network layer include:

1. **Routing**: Determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination.
2. **Logical Addressing**: Assigns IP addresses to devices and ensures that each device has a unique address.
3. **Packet Forwarding**: Moves packets from the source to the destination using routers and other network devices.
4. **Fragmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks down large packets into smaller fragments for transmission and reassembles them at the destination.

Key Protocols
-------------

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: The primary protocol for routing and addressing packets.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for error reporting and diagnostic functions.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: A distance-vector routing protocol.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: A link-state routing protocol.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: A path-vector protocol used for inter-domain routing.

Devices
-------

- **Routers**: Devices that forward data packets between computer networks.
- **Layer 3 Switches**: Network switches that operate at the network layer and can perform routing functions.

Conclusion
----------

The network layer plays a crucial role in ensuring that data is efficiently and accurately delivered across complex networks. Understanding its functions and protocols is essential for network design and troubleshooting.


IP Header
---------

The IP header is a crucial component of the IP packet, containing essential information required for routing and delivery. The fields in the IP header include:

1. **Version**: Indicates the IP version (IPv4 or IPv6). (4B)
2. **Header Length**: Specifies the length of the IP header. (4B)
3. **Type of Service (ToS)**: Defines the quality of service and priority of the packet. (8B)
    - **Type of Service (ToS)** field:
        - **Precedence**(3B): Specifies the priority of the packet.
        - **Delay**: Indicates the delay preference.
        - **Throughput**: Indicates the throughput preference.
        - **Cost**: Indicates the cost preference.
        - **Reliability**(2B): Indicates the reliability preference.

7. **Fragment Offset**: Indicates the position of the fragment in the original packet.  (13B)
 
8. **Time to Live (TTL)**: Limits the packet's lifetime to prevent it from circulating indefinitely.    (8B)
9. **Protocol**: Specifies the next layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).    (8B)
10. **Header Checksum**: Used for error-checking the header.    (16B)

11. **Source Address**: The IP address of the sender.   (32B)

12. **Destination Address**: The IP address of the receiver. (32B)

13. **Options**: Optional fields for additional control information. (40B)

14. **Data**: payload



-----------------------------------------------
Type of Network Traffic
-----------------------------------------------

Network traffic can be classified into different types based on various criteria such as the nature of the data, the purpose of the communication, and the protocols used. Some common types of network traffic include:

1. **Unicast Traffic**: Communication between a single sender and a single receiver. Most common type of network traffic.
2. **Broadcast Traffic**: Communication where a single sender transmits data to all possible receivers in the network segment.
    - its typically used for ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests or DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) requests.
    - works within LAN (Local Area Network) only.
3. **Multicast Traffic**: Communication where a single sender transmits data to multiple specific receivers who are part of a multicast group.
4. **Anycast Traffic**: Communication where data is sent from a single sender to the nearest or best receiver among a group of potential receivers.


----------------------------------------------
Decimals to Binary Conversion
----------------------------------------------
Converting decimal numbers to binary is a fundamental concept in computer science and networking. Here is a simple method to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent:

1. **Divide the decimal number by 2.**
2. **Record the remainder (0 or 1).**
3. **Update the decimal number to the quotient obtained in step 1.**
4. **Repeat steps 1-3 until the quotient is 0.**
5. **The binary number is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.**

Example:
--------

Convert the decimal number 13 to binary:

1. 13 รท 2 = 6 remainder 1
2. 6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0
3. 3 รท 2 = 1 remainder 1
4. 1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1


----------------------------------
IP Addressing on Computer Commands
----------------------------------

IP addressing is a fundamental aspect of networking, allowing devices to communicate with each other. Here are some common computer commands used to manage and troubleshoot IP addresses:

1. **ipconfig (Windows)**: Displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes DHCP and DNS settings.
    - Example: `ipconfig /all`
2. **ifconfig (Linux/Unix)**: Configures kernel-resident network interfaces.
    - Example: `ifconfig eth0`

----------------------------------
IPv4 Address to Binary Conversion
----------------------------------
Converting an IPv4 address to its binary equivalent is a common task in networking. An IPv4 address consists of four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255. Here is a step-by-step method to convert an IPv4 address to binary:

1. **Split the IPv4 address into its four octets.**
2. **Convert each octet from decimal to binary.**
3. **Combine the binary representations of all four octets.**

Example:
--------

Convert the IPv4 address 192.168.1.1 to binary:

1. Split the address: 192, 168, 1, 1
2. Convert each octet:
    - 192 in binary: 11000000
    - 168 in binary: 10101000
    - 1 in binary: 00000001
    - 1 in binary: 00000001
3. Combine the binary octets: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001

The binary representation of 192.168.1.1 is 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001.



----------------------------------
Subnet Mask 
----------------------------------
A subnet mask is used in IP networking to divide an IP address into network and host portions. It helps in determining the subnet to which an IP address belongs. The subnet mask consists of a series of consecutive 1s followed by a series of consecutive 0s. The 1s represent the network part, and the 0s represent the host part.

Example:
--------

Consider the IP address 192.168.1.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0:

1. Convert the subnet mask to binary:
    - 255.255.255.0 in binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
2. The first 24 bits (1s) represent the network part, and the last 8 bits (0s) represent the host part.
3. The network address is 192.168.1.0, and the range of host addresses is from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254.

Subnet masks are essential for efficient IP address management and network segmentation.

- 192.168.100.0 --> is network number or subnet number
- 192.168.100.255 --> is broadcast address


----------------------------------
Subnet Mask Slash Notation
----------------------------------

Subnet masks can also be represented in slash notation (CIDR notation), which indicates the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask. This notation is more concise and commonly used in networking.

Example:
--------

Consider the IP address 192.168.1.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0:

1. Convert the subnet mask to binary:
    - 255.255.255.0 in binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
2. Count the number of 1s in the binary representation: 24
3. The slash notation for the subnet mask is /24

Therefore, the IP address 192.168.1.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 can be represented as 192.168.1.1/24.

Common Subnet Masks in Slash Notation:
--------------------------------------

- 255.0.0.0 = /8
- 255.255.0.0 = /16
- 255.255.255.0 = /24
- 255.255.255.128 = /25
- 255.255.255.192 = /26
- 255.255.255.224 = /27
- 255.255.255.240 = /28
- 255.255.255.248 = /29
- 255.255.255.252 = /30

Slash notation simplifies the representation of subnet masks and is widely used in routing and network configuration.

============================
Classful Addressing: Class A
============================
Classful addressing is an IP addressing architecture used in the early days of the Internet. It divides the IP address space into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E), each with a different range of addresses and default subnet masks. Class A addresses are designed for very large networks.

- the first bit is always 0

Characteristics of Class A Addresses:
-------------------------------------

1. **Range**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
2. **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.0.0.0 (/8)
3. **Network Bits**: 8 bits
4. **Host Bits**: 24 bits
5. **Number of Networks**: 128 (2^7 - 2, excluding 0 and 127)
6. **Number of Hosts per Network**: 16,777,214 (2^24 - 2, excluding network and broadcast addresses)

Example:
--------

Consider the IP address 10.0.0.1:

1. **Network Address**: 10.0.0.0
2. **Broadcast Address**: 10.255.255.255
3. **Range of Host Addresses**: 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254

Class A addresses are typically assigned to very large organizations and ISPs due to their large number of available host addresses.

- 127.0.0.0/8 is reserved for loopback addresses and should not be assigned to hosts on a network.
- 12.0.0.0/8 is reserved for AT&T and should not be used for general addressing purposes.

- 19.0.0.0/8 is reserved for Ford Motor Company and should not be used for general addressing purposes.


============================
Classful Addressing: Class B
============================
Class B addresses are designed for medium to large-sized networks. They provide a balance between the number of networks and the number of hosts per network.

- the 1st 2 bits are always 10

Characteristics of Class B Addresses:
-------------------------------------

1. **Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255

3. **Range of Host Addresses**: 172.16.0.1 to 172.16.255.254

Class B addresses are typically assigned to large organizations and enterprises due to their substantial number of available host addresses.


============================
Classful Addressing: Class C
============================
Class C addresses are designed for small to medium-sized networks. They provide a larger number of networks with fewer hosts per network compared to Class A and B addresses.

- the first 3 bits are always 110, network will be 21 bits and host will be 8 bits

2. **Broadcast Address**: 192.168.1.255
3. **Range of Host Addresses**: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254

Class C addresses are typically assigned to small organizations and home networks due to their limited number of available host addresses.



============================
Classful Addressing: Class D
============================

Class D addresses are reserved for multicast groups. Multicast allows a single packet to be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously, making it efficient for applications like streaming media and online gaming.

Characteristics of Class D Addresses:
-------------------------------------

1. **Range**: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
2. **Default Subnet Mask**: Not applicable (multicast addresses do not use subnet masks)
3. **Network Bits**: Not applicable
4. **Host Bits**: Not applicable
5. **Number of Networks**: Not applicable
6. **Number of Hosts per Network**: Not applicable

Example:
--------

Consider the multicast address 224.0.0.1:

1. **Multicast Group Address**: 224.0.0.1

Class D addresses are used for multicast applications and are not assigned to individual hosts. Instead, they represent groups of devices that are interested in receiving specific multicast traffic.

RIP -> 224.0.0.9
EIGRP -> 224.0.0.10
OSPF -> 224.0.0.5/.6
VRRP -> 224.0.0.8
PIM -> 224.0.0.3


============================
Classful Addressing: Class E
============================

Class E addresses are reserved for experimental purposes and are not intended for general use. These addresses are used for research and development and are not assigned to any organizations or hosts.

Characteristics of Class E Addresses:
-------------------------------------

1. **Range**: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
2. **Default Subnet Mask**: Not applicable (experimental addresses do not use subnet masks)
3. **Network Bits**: Not applicable
4. **Host Bits**: Not applicable
5. **Number of Networks**: Not applicable
6. **Number of Hosts per Network**: Not applicable

Example:
--------

Consider the experimental address 240.0.0.1:

1. **Experimental Address**: 240.0.0.1

Class E addresses are reserved for future use and experimental purposes. They are not used in standard network operations and are not routable on the public Internet.



==================================
Private and Public Address Spaces
==================================

IP addresses are categorized into private and public address spaces. Private addresses are used within a local network and are not routable on the public Internet, while public addresses are globally unique and routable on the Internet.

Private Address Spaces
----------------------

Private IP addresses are reserved for use within private networks and are not routable on the public Internet. These addresses are defined by the following ranges:

- **Class A**: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
- **Class B**: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
- **Class C**: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Private addresses are commonly used in home, office, and enterprise networks. Devices within these networks communicate with each other using private addresses, and a router with Network Address Translation (NAT) is typically used to connect to the public Internet.

Public Address Spaces
---------------------

Public IP addresses are globally unique and assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and regional Internet registries (RIRs). These addresses are routable on the public Internet and are used for communication between devices across different networks.

Public IP addresses are assigned to organizations, ISPs, and end-users for use on the Internet. They ensure that each device on the Internet has a unique address, allowing for proper routing of data.

Example:
--------

Consider a home network with the following setup:

- **Private IP Address**: 192.168.1.2 (assigned to a computer within the home network)
- **Public IP Address**: 203.0.113.5 (assigned to the home router by the ISP)

In this setup, the computer uses the private IP address to communicate within the home network, while the router uses the public IP address to communicate with external devices on the Internet.

Understanding the distinction between private and public address spaces is essential for network design, configuration, and security.

- 10.x.x.x is a private IP address range that can be used for users networks.
- 192.x.x.x is a private IP address range that can be used for devices on a local network.
- 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x is a private IP address range that can be used for DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) networks.


- IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS Root, IP addressing, and other Internet protocol resources.

- Private IPs require NAT (Network Address Translation) to communicate with the public Internet.



==================================
Binary to Decimal Conversion
==================================
Converting binary numbers to decimal is a fundamental concept in computer science and networking. Here is a simple method to convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent:

1. **Write down the binary number.**
2. **Starting from the right, assign each bit a power of 2, beginning with 2^0.**
3. **Multiply each bit by its corresponding power of 2.**
4. **Sum all the products to get the decimal number.**

Example:
--------

Convert the binary number 1101 to decimal:

1. Write down the binary number: 1101
2. Assign powers of 2 to each bit:
    - 1 * 2^3 = 8
    - 1 * 2^2 = 4
    - 0 * 2^1 = 0
    - 1 * 2^0 = 1
3. Sum the products: 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

The decimal representation of the binary number 1101 is 13.



=====================================
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
=====================================

CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. It replaces the old system based on classes A, B, and C. CIDR allows for more efficient use of IP address space and improved routing.

CIDR Notation
-------------

CIDR notation specifies an IP address and its associated network prefix. The notation uses a slash (/) followed by the number of bits in the network prefix.

Example:
--------

Consider the IP address 192.168.1.0/24:

1. **IP Address**: 192.168.1.0
2. **Network Prefix**: /24 (indicating that the first 24 bits are the network part)

CIDR Benefits
-------------

1. **Efficient IP Address Allocation**: Reduces the wastage of IP addresses.
2. **Improved Routing**: Aggregates routes to minimize the size of routing tables.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows for variable-length subnet masking (VLSM).

CIDR Example
------------

Consider the IP address 192.168.1.0/24:

1. **Binary Representation**: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
2. **Network Prefix**: /24 (first 24 bits are the network part)
3. **Host Range**: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254

CIDR is widely used in modern networking for efficient IP address management and routing.


==============================================
# Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) Notes
==============================================
**Overview**
- VLSM allows different subnets within the same network to have different subnet masks.
- Enables more efficient allocation of IP addresses compared to Fixed-Length Subnet Masking (FLSM).

**Key Concepts**
1. **Subnet Mask:** Divides an IP address into network and host portions.
2. **Fixed-Length Subnet Masking (FLSM):** All subnets use the same subnet mask.

Converting Slash Notation to Dotted Decimal
=============================================

Converting a subnet mask from slash notation (CIDR notation) to dotted decimal format is a common task in networking. Here is a step-by-step method to perform the conversion:

1. **Determine the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.**
2. **Write the binary representation of the subnet mask with the specified number of 1s followed by 0s to make a total of 32 bits.**
3. **Divide the 32-bit binary number into four 8-bit octets.**
4. **Convert each 8-bit binary octet to its decimal equivalent.**
5. **Combine the four decimal octets to form the dotted decimal subnet mask.**

Example:
--------

Convert the slash notation /24 to dotted decimal:

1. **Number of bits set to 1**: 24

=============================================
IP Subnet-Zero Command
=============================================

## Overview
- The `ip subnet-zero` command controls whether the all-zeroes subnet (subnet zero) can be used in IP addressing.
- By default, older Cisco IOS versions disable the use of subnet zero for compatibility reasons.
- Modern networks typically enable the use of subnet zero to maximize IP address utilization.

## Key Concepts
1. **Subnet Zero:**
   - Refers to the first subnet in a network, where all bits in the subnet portion are zeroes.
   - Example: In a `/27` subnet (`255.255.255.224`), the subnet zero would be `x.x.x.0/27`.

2. **Broadcast Subnet:**
   - Refers to the last subnet in a network, where all bits in the host portion are ones.
   - Example: In a `/27` subnet, the broadcast subnet would be `x.x.x.32/27`.

3. **RFC 950:**
   - Initially recommended against using subnet zero and the broadcast subnet for historical reasons.
   - Modern implementations have relaxed these restrictions to improve IP address efficiency.

## Enabling Subnet Zero

### Default Behavior (Older IOS Versions)
- By default, older Cisco IOS versions do not allow the use of subnet zero.
- Example configuration without `ip subnet-zero`:

Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.224
Router(config-if)# no ip subnet-zero

### Enabling Subnet Zero
- To enable the use of subnet zero, you need to explicitly configure the router with the `ip subnet-zero` command.
- Example configuration enabling subnet zero:

Router(config)# ip subnet-zero
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.224

## Benefits of Using Subnet Zero
- **Efficient Use of IP Addresses:** Allows for an additional usable subnet, maximizing the number of subnets available within a given network.
- **Simplified Addressing:** Reduces complexity by allowing more flexible allocation of IP addresses.
- **Modern Standards Compliance:** Aligns with current RFC recommendations and best practices.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Without Subnet Zero
- Network: `192.168.1.0/27` (Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.224`)
- Usable Subnets: `192.168.1.32/27`, `192.168.1.64/27`, etc. (Subnet zero `192.168.1.0/27` cannot be used)

### Scenario 2: With Subnet Zero
- Network: `192.168.1.0/27` (Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.224`)
- Usable Subnets: `192.168.1.0/27`, `192.168.1.32/27`, `192.168.1.64/27`, etc. (Including subnet zero)

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Enter Global Configuration Mode
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)#


### Step 2: Enable Subnet Zero
Router(config)# ip subnet-zero


### Step 3: Configure Interface IP Address
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.224
Router(config-if)# no shutdown


### Step 4: Verify Configuration
Router# show running-config
Router# show ip interface brief


## Summary Table

| Feature               | Without Subnet Zero | With Subnet Zero |
|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Usable Subnets        | Excludes `0/27`     | Includes `0/27`  |
| Efficiency            | Less efficient      | More efficient   |
| Compliance            | Older standards     | Modern standards |

## Conclusion
- The `ip subnet-zero` command allows the use of the all-zeroes subnet, improving IP address efficiency and simplifying network addressing.
- Modern networks typically enable this feature to maximize IP resource utilization.
- Proper configuration and verification ensure that your network complies with current best practices and standards.
